## Overview

Welcome to Arm DevSummit 2022. This workshop is to show you how to get started developing with [Matter](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/) and [Arm Virtual Hardware](https://www.arm.com/products/development-tools/simulation/virtual-hardware).

**Attendees must provide their own laptop (with browser).**

This session is a hands-on workshop connecting to Arm Virtual Hardware in the cloud. Arm Virtual Hardware has been thoroughly tested with Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
* Instantiate Arm Virtual Hardware instances
* Build and run Matter examples on Arm Virtual Hardware
  * Demonstrate communication between two virtual hardware targets
* Use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to manage ongoing development
  * Automated CI/CD workflow

## Prerequisites

To participate in the workshops, users must prepare **in advance** of the workshop:

 - User account for [Arm Virtual Hardware](https://avh.arm.com/)
   - **OPEN ACTION** Will demonstration accounts be available on-site?
