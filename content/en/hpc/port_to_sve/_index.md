    Learning path for porting code from NEON to the Arm Scalable Vector Extension (SVE).
---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this learning path, you will be able to:

* Understand the differences between SVE and NEON for vectorization
* Compile code for SVE-capable Arm processors
* Run SVE instructions on any Armv8-A processor

## Pre-requisites

General knowledge about SIMD processing, vectorization or NEON.
