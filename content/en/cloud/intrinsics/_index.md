    Learning path for porting architecture specific intrinics to Arm Neoverse processors
---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this learning path, you will be able to:

* Understand what intrinsics are and how to find them in code
* Evaluate options and use header-only libraries to port architecture specific intrinics to Arm Neoverse

## Pre-requisites

Access to an Arm Neoverse machine running Linux. Free tier machines are available in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Oracle Cloud (OCI)
