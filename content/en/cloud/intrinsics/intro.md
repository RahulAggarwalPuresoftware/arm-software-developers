    An introduction to architecture specific intrinsics for Arm Neoverse processors.
---

Migrating C/C++ applications from x64 to Arm requires recompiling the source code for the Arm architecture. The marketing message of a “simple recompile” works much of the time, but not always. SIMD extensions are one of the common barriers encountered when porting C/C++ applications from x64 to Arm. This article is a short background on intrinsics and how to identify them in code. This learning path presents options for how to get the code compiled and running on Arm Neoverse. 

### **What are intrinsics?**

Intrinsics are functions which are built into the compiler and not part of a library. They look like function calls, but don’t require an actual function call. When the compiler encounters intrinsics it directly substitutes a sequence of instructions. Intrinsics are often used to access special instructions that don’t have a direct mapping from C/C++ or when performance optimization is needed. 

One use of intrinsics is to access SIMD (single-instruction, multiple-data) instructions directly from C/C++ for improved application performance. Intrinsics are easier to work with compared to assembly language, but they often pose a challenge when porting source code to a new architecture. This portability barrier is not very appealing if you were thinking a recompile was all that was needed. The situation may be worse if you are not familiar with the code.

Intel Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) and [Arm NEON](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dht0002/a/Introducing-NEON/NEON-architecture-overview/NEON-instructions) SIMD instructions increase processor throughput by performing multiple computations with a single instruction. Over the years, Intel and Arm have introduced a variety of SIMD extensions. NEON is used in many of the Arm Cortex-R, Cortex-A, and Neoverse processors.

If you are not familiar with SIMD instructions there are numerous tutorials available. There are generally 3 ways to program SIMD hardware:

1. The C/C++ compiler recognizes opportunities to use SIMD instructions and inserts them automatically (with or without some guidance)
2. Intrinsics to access SIMD instructions directly from C/C++ source code
3. Assembly programming 

### **Source code example**

Below is a small example which demonstrates an application with intrinsics in it. The source code comes from a [short course titled Efficient Vectorisation with C++](https://chryswoods.com/vector_c++/emmintrin.html) and is copyright (C) Christopher Woods, 2006-2015 and is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

We use this example to show how to get the example running on Arm neoverse.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#ifdef __SSE2__
  #include <emmintrin.h>
#else
  #warning SSE2 support is not available. Code will not compile
#endif

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    __m128 a = _mm_set_ps(4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0);
    __m128 b = _mm_set_ps(8.0, 7.0, 6.0, 5.0);

    __m128 c = _mm_add_ps(a, b);

    float d[4];
    _mm_storeu_ps(d, c);

    std::cout << "result equals " << d[0] << "," << d[1]
              << "," << d[2] << "," << d[3] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

First, we see a reference to the \_\_SSE2\_\_ preprocessor define and the emmintrin.h header file. These are architecture specific extensions, the function calls starting with _mm are Intel SSE intrinsics.

Copy the above source code into a file named sse.cpp 

Compile the code on the x86_64 architecture using the commands: 

```console
g++ -O2 -msse2 --std=c++14 sse.cpp -o sse
./sse
```

The printed resuls should be:
```console
result equals 6,8,10,12
```

In the next sections will show how to migrate this application to Arm Neoverse.
